# Real-Time Fire Detection with YOLOv8

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time fire detection system using the YOLOv8 model. The project is designed to identify and locate fire in various environments swiftly, which can be critical for early warning systems in smart buildings, forests, and urban areas.

## Project Overview

Fire detection is a crucial safety feature for preventing damage and loss of life. Traditional fire detection systems often rely on smoke and temperature sensors, which may not be effective in open or large spaces. This project leverages the power of the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect fire visually in real time from video feeds.

### Features

- **Real-time detection:** Uses live video streams to detect fire.
- **High accuracy:** YOLOv8 provides excellent accuracy in detection with real-time processing.
- **Wide area coverage:** Capable of detecting fire over large areas using camera feeds.
- **Early detection:** Potentially identifies fire sooner than traditional methods.
